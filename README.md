# Graphing-Calculator

This program is inspired by the TI-84 graphing calculator and is able to perform arithmetic with complex numbers and graph up to 10 functions with modifiable window sizes (including rectangular, polar, and parametric functions). There is currently some matrix functionality in the code, but as it is not yet fully implemented, it is currently disabled in the executable program.

In order to check out the current state of the graphing calculator, simply execute GraphingCalculator.jar.
